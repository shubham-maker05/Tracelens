/**
 * Burns a [StampSpec] into a captured photo. Building the spec
 * ([buildStampSpec]) is pure data resolution; the actual drawing is
 * [StampPainter.draw], the exact same function Phase 5's live viewfinder
 * overlay calls from inside a Compose `Canvas` — this function's only job
 * is to drive that same draw call outside of any Composition, against a
 * `CanvasDrawScope` wrapping the target bitmap's own `android.graphics.Canvas`.
 *
 * Density note, easy to get subtly wrong: [StampPainter] uses `.dp`/`.sp`
 * sizing for small fixed details (padding, stroke width, font size), which
 * are density-relative by design in Compose. If this burn-in used the real
 * device's screen density, a "12sp" label would come out a completely
 * different *proportion* of a high-resolution sensor photo than it did on
 * the (much lower-resolution) live preview, breaking the whole "what you
 * frame is what burns in" guarantee at exactly the most visible level: text
 * size. The fix is a synthetic density scaled to the image's own pixel
 * width against a fixed reference (360dp, a common phone width baseline),
 * so "the image is 360dp wide" is true regardless of whether the image is
 * actually 1080px (a live preview) or 4032px (a full-resolution capture).
 * Phase 5's live-overlay `Canvas` composable must use this same synthetic
 * density, not `LocalDensity.current`, or the two will drift apart again.
